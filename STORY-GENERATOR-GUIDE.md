## Examples of Great Prompts

### 1. Maximum Detail ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
I want a gothic war romance set in a cursed kingdom during 
a century-long war. The protagonist is a battle-hardened 
general named Marcus who has lost faith in everything except 
duty. He meets Elara, a mysterious healer with silver eyes 
who can see death before it comes. Include dark blood magic, 
political betrayal, forbidden love that could doom the kingdom, 
and epic siege battles. The tone should be atmospheric, 
dramatic, and morally complex. Think Game of Thrones meets 
Wuthering Heights.
```

A space opera meets murder mystery where a cynical detective 
investigates a murder on a luxury starship. The victim is a 
diplomat, suspects include aliens and androids, and there's 
a conspiracy that reaches the galactic senate. Noir atmosphere, 
witty dialogue, sci-fi technology, locked-room mystery. 
Agatha Christie in space!
```

### 3. Simple but Clear ⭐⭐⭐
```
Young adult fantasy about teenage witches at a magic academy. 
Four students from rival houses must work together to stop 
an ancient evil. Includes spellcasting competitions, teenage 
drama, dark secrets, and chosen one prophecy. Fun and dramatic.
